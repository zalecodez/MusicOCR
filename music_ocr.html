<h1> Music OCR </h1>
<h2> by Zale and Vaasu </h2>

We have created a program that takes an image of sheet music, and prints out the notes to play.

<p>
<h2>Assumptions:</h2>
<p>
1) The key signature is C
<p>
2) Every note has the same rhythm.
<p>
3) No sharps or flats
<p>
4) All notes are within 1 ledger of the staff
<p>
5) Treble Clef
<p>
<h2> Method: </h2>
<p>
Step 1) Find lines using hough transform
	
	
<p>
Step 2) Filter lines by length and angle to determine staff lines
	
		

<p>
Step 3) Find a set of 5 lines that comprise a staff by looking at the gap between the lines
<p>
Step 4) Scan each staff using a window to find notes and their corresponding position in the 		staff.
<p>
Step 5) Label the notes and print out their pitch!
<p>

<h2> User interface: </h2>
<p>
Since this uses hough transform, users enter these parameters into the command line,
<p>
./ sigma lo hi nBlur mincnt avgthresh in.png out.png
<p>
avgthresh is specific to our program, and determines the average darkness of the scan window at which we will consider something a note.
