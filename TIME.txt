1. I created the 2 structs (liness.h and note.h) and the functions checkNotes 
    and makeStaff in main.cpp. I also modified the drawLine function in 
    houghL.cpp to only print lines of interest and their actual lengths as
    well as populate the array of lines. 

2. 50% - Vaasu and I discussed the concepts a lot together and, while I wrote 
    most of the actual functionality, Vaasu did just as much of the testing 
    and the entire website, as well as much functionality that we didn't have 
    time to implement yet, so it evened out. 

3. about 8 or 9 hours - mostly spent debugging and finding flaws in my logic.
